### What I learned

Working on these challenge reinforced my knowledge of using the anchor element and the target atrribute. By default when you click a hyperlink nested in an anchor element it opens in the same window, but when you set the target to "_blank" as below it opens in a new window.
```` html
<a href="www.example.com" target="_blank">www.example.com</a>
````
